# Minecraft Plugin Basic Setup

I created this repository for my article "Minecraft Plugin Development - A Hands-On Crash Course". This is for you to download to get your first project setup if you need that help. Note that you should change the group id and package name to uniquely identify your own project. To do so, change the contents of the group id tag in the pom.xml file to be your group id. As well, rename the package from "me.john.amiscaray.minecraftplugindevelopmenttutorial" to "(yourgroupid).minecraftplugindevelopmenttutorial". After doing so, change value of the "main" in the plugin.yml file from "me.john.amiscaray.minecraftplugindevelopmenttutorial.MinecraftPluginDevelopmentTutorial", to "(yourgroupid).minecraftplugindevelopmenttutorial.MinecraftPluginDevelopmentTutorial". Happy Coding!
